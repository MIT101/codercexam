<h3>REASONS TO MOVE TO USA</h3>
<h4>A.The majority of the year is sunny and warm</h4>
Why are so many people moving to Florida? For the weather, of course! With more than 200 sunshine-filled days a year, Florida offers newcomers exceptionally warm and sunny weather. Despite the hot and humid summers, Florida seasons tend to be mostly mild and warm. Those living in the southern portion of the Sunshine State will likely never need more than a sweater during the winter. With so many warm and sunny days a year, residents can spend less time indoors and more time outdoors exploring all that Florida has to offer.

<h4>B.There’s no state income tax</h4>
Looking to save more money on a monthly basis? Consider moving to Florida. While the majority of U.S. states require residents to pay state income taxes, the State of Florida does not. Fortunately for Florida residents, this lack of income tax allows them to save more of their hard-earned money for fun activities, vacations and belongings.

<h4>C.The beaches are fantastic</h4>
Life really is a beach in Florida. Residents have access to some of the world’s best and most beautiful beaches right outside their doors. Well-known and award-winning beaches in Florida include Sarasota’s Siesta Public Beach, which was named the number one beach in the U.S. by TripAdvisor, Clearwater Beach, Pensacola Beach, Delray Beach, St. Joseph Peninsula State Park, Panama City Public Beach, Grayton Beach and St. George Island – just to name a few. 

<h4>D.There’s plenty of cultural diversity</h4>
There’s no other state quite like Florida when it comes to cultural diversity. Throughout the state, you’ll find people of every age, religion and background imaginable, making it one of the greatest melting pots in the country. In addition to those who are born and raised in Florida, many residents include snow birds and transplants from different states who have moved for the weather, job opportunities and tax benefits. Given its coastal location, Florida also attracts a large Latino population. The state’s diversity is without a doubt one of the reasons why Florida is such an interesting place to live.</p>

<h3>REASONS TO MOVE TO CANADA<h3>
<h4>1. CANDA IS RATED ONE OF THE SAFEST PLACES TO LIVE IN</h4>
<p>Want to know about some of the most peaceful cities to live in? Here is a list that was updated in 2019 to help you select the best provinces and cities to live in.

The city of Saguenay in Quebec is a great place to move to as it is one of the top ten safest places to live in Canada according to a report by Mcleans in 2017. If you are a french speaking immigrant, then consider giving this city a try as 95% of the residents are French speakers. The city itself is picturesque and is best known for its Saguenay Fjord National park.

The city of St. Catherines in Ontario also makes the list. Situated next door to the iconic Niagara Falls, this city has one of the safest environments with low crime rates and has continually declining crime rates according to Statistic Canada.

The city has been nicknamed the Garden City because it has both natural beauty and quaint city life with a thriving art and theatre scene. In recent years, the city has also begun to emerge as a regional technological hub.

Ottawa is another great place to move to in Canada. With a blend of English and French speakers and one of the biggest growing job markets around, the city offers both employment options and fantastic festivals like the Winterlude Winter Carnival.  </p>

<h4>2. CANADA WAHTS TO INVITE 1.3 MILLION IMMIGRANTS BY 2021</h4>
<p1>Canada has one of the largest numbers of visa options to help immigrants move to Canada! Currently, there are over 70 immigration options that are on offer across the different provinces and territories. 

Canada has continually boosted its immigration targets for each year and this year has broken last year's immigration records for the most Invitations to Apply (ITAs) ever.    

The country even increased the number of sponsorship programs, such as the Parent and Grandparent Sponsorship program, to help you get the rest of your family to Canada. Not only that but certain visas are designed for specific jobs such as the BC Semi-Skilled category that lets the province select workers who have experience in hospitality, long-distance transport, and processing to become permanent residents.  </p1>
